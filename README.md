# Notes
- Based on the OC-EKF Matlab code of Prof. Guoquang Huang
- To add iSAM, you can dowload it and obtaint install instructions at: https://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/isam/doc/index.html
- Change simulation parameters in the main script (main.m) as needed both for simulation and real data
- Run main.m
